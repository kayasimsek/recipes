    <p> This thin-crust focaccia is topped with sliced mushrooms and ricotta cheese, making for a delicious and flavorful combination. The crust is crispy and light, providing the perfect base for the creamy ricotta and earthy mushrooms. The pizza is easy to assemble and bake, making it a great choice for a homemade meal or a fun dinner party. </p>
    <p> <h2> Ingredients </h2> </p>
    <ul>
        <li> 36 oz all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 710 g water </li>
        <li> 3/4 tsp yeast </li>
        <li> 45 g salt </li>
        <li> 1 lb sliced mushrooms </li>
        <li> 2 cups ricotta cheese </li>

    </ul>
    <p> <h2> Instructions </h2> </p>
    <ol> 
        <li> Mix the flour, yeast, salt, and water in a bowl to make the pizza dough. Knead the dough, let it rise for 1-2 hours, then divide it into 6 pieces. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat up. </li>
        <li> Mix the ricotta cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make the topping. </li>
        <li> Roll out the dough on a floured surface and place it on a piece of parchment paper dusted with cornmeal. </li>
        <li> Brush the dough with olive oil, then spread the ricotta mixture on the pizza, leaving a 1/2-inch (1 cm) border around the edges. Top with sliced mushrooms. </li>
        <li> Slide the pizza (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. </li>
        <li> Serve warm and enjoy! </li>
